# Ionospheric-Physics-Project
A simulation of cloud diffusion and cloud brightness evolution using explicit finite differencing. For a project involving ionospheric physics.

There is only one file uploaded: the project is rudimentary and not intended to be a full display of my programming ability. The major aspects of the code are all contained in the same file and so will inevitably look quite messy.
