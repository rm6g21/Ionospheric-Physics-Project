# Ionospheric-Physics-Project
A simulation of cloud diffusion and cloud brightness evolution using explicit finite differencing. For a project involving ionospheric physics.

There is only one file uploaded: the project is rudimentary and not intended to be a full display of my programming ability. The major aspects of the code are all contained in the same file and so will inevitably look quite messy.

The pdf is the end result of the project. The writing style is basic (and in parts sloppy) and is not intended to be a display of my writing ability, it is only there to add more context into what some of the code was doing.
